The Heroku-Url is the Backend Application that actually stores the Data and collects Logfiles.\r\n\r\nYou can reach out to me on privacy issues at drkslv@gmx.de\r\n\r\n## What Data do I collect?\r\n\r\n#### Log-Files\r\nDRKSLV-Discussion follows a standard procedure of using log files. These files log visitors when they visit websites. All hosting companies do this and a part of hosting services' analytics. The information collected by log files include internet protocol (**IP**) addresses, **browser type**, Internet Service Provider (**ISP**), **date and time stamp**, referring/exit **pages**, and possibly the number of **clicks**. These are not linked to any information that is personally identifiable. \r\n\r\nThe purpose of that information is for analysing trends, administering the site, tracking the audience's movement on the website, and gathering demographic information.\r\n\r\n#### User-Account\r\nWhen you register a User-Account with me, I store:\r\n- A pseudonymous **username**\r\n- Your **email address**\r\n- whether you have **verified** your email address \r\n- whether you have been granted **Moderator-Rights**\r\n- your **password** in encrypted form (bcrypt hashing algorithm)\r\n- date and time of **creation**\r\n- date and time of **last edit**\r\n\r\nOnly your Username, Moderator-Rights and the Date of Creation will be shown publicly.  \r\n\r\nThis Information is used to provide a public identity to the people using my site. \r\nYour email address and Password are used to prove your identity.\r\n\r\n**I reserve my right to terminate your User-Account at any Time, for any Reason.**\r\n\r\n#### Posts, Comments and Votes\r\nYou can *voluntarily* choose to participate in discussion on my platform.\r\nThis means creating **Posts**, **Comments** and **Voting** on other users' contributions.\r\n\r\nYour Posts and Comments store their Creation and Edit **timestamps**, as well as their **author** (which associates them with your account) \r\nPosts have a **title** and a **text body**, Comments only have the **text**.\r\nComments store their position in the **comment hierarchy** and which post they belong to.\r\n\r\nYou can edit and correct the text body of posts and comments.\r\n\r\nWhen you delete a post or comment, it is de-associated with your account and the text-body will be deleted. \r\nHowever, post titles and comment hierarchies will be persisted to provide context to other users contributions that were replying to your post or comment.\r\n\r\nBecause titles are persisted, please don\u2019t use them to convey sensitive personal data!\r\n\r\nVotes store the date and time you voted, the content you were voting on, and are associated with your account. You can withdraw a vote at any time, and when you delete your account all your votes will be lost as well.\r\n\r\n## What Data do I collect?\r\nI collect:\r\n- **Log Files** -- when you visit my website or access features of the underlying application.\r\n- **User-Account Information** -- when you choose to register an account with me.\r\n- **Post, Comment or Vote Information** -- whenever you voluntarily choose to create them.\r\n\r\n## How will I use your Data?\r\nI collect your data so I can:\r\n\r\n- *Analyse* traffic and use of my website and application (I don't rlly bother tho)\r\n- *Manage* your account and provide a virtual Identity for you\r\n- *Create* a space were people can share content and vote on or reply to it\r\n- *Email* you critical notices via email (will never happen prlly)\r\n\r\n## How do I store your data?\r\nI store your data on a free instance of heroku-postgres. \r\nYour User-Account's password is encrypted securely using the bcrypt hashing algorithm.\r\nThe Database is locked with an username and password based authentication system. Username and Password were chosen entirely randomly and are of sufficient length to prevent brute-force attacks.\r\n\r\nI keep your **User Information, Posts, Comments and Votes** *for as long as you desire*.\r\n\r\nI keep **log files** *indefinitely*.\r\n(I actually don't know how long they are kept, but I don't care, so I just reserve my right to hold onto them, since they do not contain sensitive data)\r\n\r\n## Marketing (none)\r\nYour Information is not shared with any third-parties. \r\n\r\nI do not run ads or track unauthenticated users on the Website.\r\n\r\nSo there is basically no Marketing going on here.\r\n\r\n## What are your data protection rights?\r\nI would like to make sure you are fully aware of all of your data protection rights.
